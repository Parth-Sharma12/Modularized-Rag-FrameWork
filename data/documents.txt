Large Language Models (LLMs) generate text based on patterns learned from massive datasets but do not have true understanding or access to real-time facts.

LLMs are prone to hallucinations, where they produce confident but incorrect or fabricated information.

Hallucinations often occur when the model is asked questions outside its training data or when sufficient context is not provided.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) reduces hallucinations by grounding the model’s responses in external knowledge sources.

In a RAG system, a vector database retrieves semantically similar documents based on embeddings.

Vector similarity search is fast but can retrieve irrelevant or weakly related documents due to semantic overlap.

Cross-encoder re-ranking improves retrieval quality by jointly evaluating the query and each candidate document.

Re-ranking models are slower than vector search but significantly improve precision.

RAG pipelines typically follow four steps: embedding, retrieval, re-ranking, and generation.

Providing high-quality context to the language model improves factual accuracy and reduces hallucination risk.

Without re-ranking, LLMs may receive noisy or misleading context.

Using only a vector database is often insufficient for high-stakes applications like healthcare or finance.

Hybrid RAG architectures balance speed and accuracy by combining vector search with re-ranking.

Context window limitations require careful selection of the most relevant chunks.

Proper evaluation of RAG systems includes measuring retrieval precision, answer correctness, and latency.
